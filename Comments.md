Comments can be added to a post on metasmoke to note any related information of importance. For example, they can be used to:

* Record the reasoning behind a specific feedback
* Discuss conflicting feedback (note: no-one gets notifications for new comments on a post)
* Link anything of relevance (e.g. other posts in a spam wave, similar spam posts, plagiarised sources)
* Provide translations of foreign language posts

Comments can be created in two ways: directly on metasmoke, and via SmokeDetector:

## Adding comments via chat

Note: [SmokeDetector review privileges](https://charcoal-se.org/smokey/Privileges#smokedetector-privileges-sd) required, and your metasmoke account must be linked to your chat profile.

If you reply to any report posted by SmokeDetector in chat, some or all of your message will be automatically added as a comment on metasmoke.

* When adding feedback, all of your message after the feedback code will be taken as a comment.

  e.g. `↰@SmokeDetector k Self promotion - no disclosure` will post `Self promotion - no disclosure` as a comment, and tpu- as a feedback

* Any standard (non-feedback/command) reply will add your entire message as a comment.

  e.g. `↰@SmokeDetector This looks fishy` will post `This looks fishy` as a comment

## Viewing comments

Comments on a post will appear underneath the domains section and above the 'add comment' button.
