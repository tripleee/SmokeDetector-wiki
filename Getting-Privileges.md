SmokeDetector operates a privilege system. That is, before you are able to use a number of commands (most notably the feedback commands), you must be added to a list of privileged users in SmokeDetector's code.

## Getting Privileged
In theory, anyone can be added to the privilege list. In practice, this doesn't always work out, so *as a general guideline*, we look for a few things to indicate how qualified you are.

- **Reputation**  
  A higher reputation score indicates a higher level of participation on the sites, which is strongly correlated with moderation ability. We're looking for enough rep to indicate that you've been around a little while: generally, 300 on one site will suffice.

- **Participation**  
  We can also simply look through your various accounts on the network. SmokeDetector scans posts for spam network-wide, so the more sites you have accounts on, the better it is for everyone - more accounts means you can flag spam on more sites. We may also look at how active you've been on various sites (and on their meta sites) to determine how able you are to moderate content effectively. Again, we're not looking for a massive or exceptional record, just enough to show that you know what you're doing.

- **Referral**  
  If your request for privileges is supported by a regular of one of the [chat rooms](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki/Chat-Rooms) that SmokeDetector posts reports to, we'll look more favourably upon it - we tend to trust people who are already part of the system to make sound judgements. Additionally, if you've been around in one of the rooms for a while and have made yourself known, you've got a good chance.

These are all general guidelines, rather than hard limits. We understand that there are cases of users who have little apparent activity who can be excellent at moderation; we're also aware that the converse is true. Take note of what's mentioned here, but also remember that requests are judged on a case-by-case basis.

#### For Moderators
If you're a Stack Exchange network moderator, **you're automatically privileged**. You don't need to be added to the explicit privilege lists, as your diamond also gives you privileges with SmokeDetector. We assume that moderators are, on the whole, pretty good at moderation.

## Standard of Behaviour
Stack Exchange has a [Be Nice policy](http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice) - if you're not familiar with it, you should go and read it now. Go on - I'll wait.

As a SmokeDetector user, we expect everyone to abide by that policy. We also extend that standard a little: we expect that you take a professional and constructive approach to moderation, and that you're capable of getting on with the users and administrators of SmokeDetector. Remember - *getting along* is not the same as *liking*. Additionally, the chatrooms are a professional environment - we're friendly and laughing and joking are fine, but keep it professional.

The [unofficial standard](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/29760077#29760077) is this:

> If a system administrator ends up getting pinged more than once because you're abusing the system or seriously bugging other users, your privileges are likely to be revoked.

Exercise some common sense, bring your sense of humour, and we'll all get along just fine.
