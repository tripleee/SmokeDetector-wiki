We are participating in the closed beta of Channels, a new feature Stack Overflow is testing.

In order to participate, you need to have an email address hosted at `charcoal-se.org`

If you don't already have one, send an email to Art at charcoal-se.org from the email address you'd like to use, and Art will set you up with an @charcoal-se.org address.

The Channels sign-up asks for your email address, then dispatches the Stack Overflow login page to associate your Stack Overflow account with that address for using Channels.

Once you have an approved address, you can join the Charcoal team in Channels at https://stackoverflow.com/c/charcoal/join

(During early private beta the list of approved domains was larger, but that changed.)
