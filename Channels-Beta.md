We are participating in the closed beta of Channels, a new feature Stack Overflow is testing.

In order to participate, you need to have an email address in one of the following domains:

    charcoal-se.org
    gmail.com
    hotmail.com
    yahoo.com
    icloud.com

If you have an email address under one of the latter 4 domains, please use that. Go to https://stackoverflow.com/c/charcoal/join and enter your email address there.

If not, send an email to Art at charcoal-se.org from the email address you'd like to use, and Art will set you up with an @charcoal-se.org address.

The Channels sign-up asks for your email address, then dispatches the Stack Overflow login page to associate your Stack Overflow account with that address for using Channels.

Once you have an address in one of these domains, you can join the Charcoal team in Channels at https://stackoverflow.com/c/charcoal/join
