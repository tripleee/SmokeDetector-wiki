We are participating in the closed beta of Channels, a new feature Stack Overflow is testing.

In order to participate, you need to have an email address in one of the following domains:

    charcoal-se.org
    gmail.com
    hotmail.com
    yahoo.com
    icloud.com

We are creating `charcoal-se.org` addresses for regular users; fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3YlWSrVP7f8jkHs_xHbwLH_nicuNpCwcLydu2tErxmEFCYQ/viewform) with an address of your liking in some other domain.

If you have access to an address in one of the other domains, there is no need per se to fill in the form.

The Channels sign-up asks for your email address, then dispatches the Stack Overflow login page to associate your Stack Overflow account with that address for using Channels.
