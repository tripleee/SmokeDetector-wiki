Caution: At this point in time, this page is an ad-hoc summary of work in progress.

We are looking into automating flags from Smokey.  Basically, it will look as if though Smokey clicks "flag" -> "spam" as soon as Smoke Detector reports a post (with some checks to keep out low-accuracy heuristics from causing a flag to be cast).

We are working out the details of the system.  Technically, the flagging is done by Metasmoke (the back end component) on behalf of a user who signed up to allow the system to cast flags on their behalf (currently only the core developers, @Undo and @ArtofCode).

To participate in the development of this feature, please show up in [the Charcoal HQ chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq) and wait for a good moment to bring up your topic (afternoon UTC seems to be a fairly busy time in the room).

The main dashboard (status, statistics, etc) is at https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging
