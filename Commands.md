# Privileged commands

These commands require privileges.

# Privileged commands as reply

These commands require privileges, and have to be posted as a reply to a message of SmokeDetector.

 - `tp` or `true` - Marks a reported post as true positive.
 - `tpu` or `trueu` - Marks a reported post as true positive and adds the poster to the blacklist.
 - `fp` or `false` - Marks a reported post as false positive.
 - `fpu` or `falseu` - Marks a reported post as false positive and adds the poster to the whitelist.
 - `ignore` - Makes SmokeDetector ignore a reported post.
 - `delete`, `remove` or `gone` - Deletes a message of SmokeDetector.

# Silent mode

If you want that SmokeDetector does not reply when executing a command, add a `-` sign at the end, for example `fp-`.

# Shortcut commands

You can now use a shortcut to post a reply to one, two or three messages
at the same time, in this shape:

    sd cmd1
    sd cmd1 cmd2
    sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3
    sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 cmd4
    sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 cmd4 cmd5

cmd1 will be invoked in the most recent message, cmd2 on the message
before that and cmd3 on the message before that, and so on.

It's also possible to skip a message. Replace a command by a - to skip a
message. For example, `sd - delete` skips the most recent message and
deletes the message before that one.

Smokey will reply to your shortcut command, unless all commands have quiet
mode (like tp-) or just don't reply by default (like delete).

A few examples:

- `sd - delete` keeps the most recent message and deletes the one before that.
- `sd tp fp delete` marks the most recent message as tp, the one before that as fp, and deletes the one before that.

You can also put a digit in front of a command so the command will apply as many times as the digit. A few examples:

- `sd 2tpu` == `sd tpu tpu`
- `sd 2tpu 3fpu` == `sd tpu tpu fpu fpu fpu`
- `sd 2- fp` == `sd - - fp`
