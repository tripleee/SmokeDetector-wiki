SmokeDetector is a headless chatbot that detects spam and posts it to chatrooms.  
It uses [ChatExchange](https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange) and takes questions from [the Stack Exchange realtime tab](http://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=realtime).

You can find a list of **SmokeDetector's commands** on [the Commands wiki page](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki/Commands).

Find a list of **chatrooms that SmokeDetector interacts with** on [the Chat Rooms wiki page](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki/Chat-Rooms).

If you're thinking about **asking for privileges**, take a look at the [Getting Privileges](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki/Getting-Privileges) page.

###Glossary:

- **Blacklist** - list of users whose every question or answer will be posted to the appropriate chatrooms. This should be used **only for spammers or** for users whose posts merit **abusive/offensive flags.**

- **Whitelist** - list of users which are free from username checks on their posts. Title and body will still be checked.
