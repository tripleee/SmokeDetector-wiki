SmokeDetector is a headless chatbot that detects spam and posts it to chatrooms.  
It uses [ChatExchange](https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange) and takes questions from [the Stack Exchange realtime tab](http://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=realtime). For more information on how it works, see our website at [charcoal-se.org](https://charcoal-se.org/).
